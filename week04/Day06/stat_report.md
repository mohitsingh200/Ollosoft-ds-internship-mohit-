# Introduction

This report analyze s five Indian large-cap stocks using statistical techniques including return distributions, correlation analysis, volatility measurement, and risk-adjusted performance evaluation through the Sharpe Ratio. Historical daily price data was downloaded using yfinance and analyzed using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.



# Return Distribution Analysis

Daily log returns were calculated for all stocks. Histograms and Q-Q plots were used to compare observed returns with a normal distribution.

### Observation

The return distributions are approximately centered around zero but exhibit heavier tails than a perfect normal distribution. This indicates that extreme price movements occur more frequently than predicted by the normal model.



# Correlation Analysis

A Pearson correlation matrix was computed to understand relationships between stock returns.

### Observation

The banking stocks HDFCBANK and ICICIBANK showed strong positive correlation. Technology stocks TCS and INFY were also highly correlated. Diversification benefits are generally greater when combining stocks with lower correlation.



# Sharpe Ratio Analysis

Sharpe Ratio measures risk-adjusted returns.

Formula:

Sharpe Ratio = (Annual Return − Risk-Free Rate) / Annual Volatility

Risk-Free Rate Assumed = 6.5%

### Observation

Stocks with higher Sharpe Ratios delivered better returns relative to their risk. The ranking indicates which stocks were most efficient from a risk-adjusted perspective during the analysis period.



# Conclusion

The analysis shows that correlations exist across sectors, but diversification opportunities remain available. Return distributions are not perfectly normal, highlighting the importance of risk management. Based on Sharpe Ratio rankings, some stocks provided superior risk-adjusted performance compared to others.

This study demonstrates how statistical techniques can be applied to financial market data for portfolio analysis and investment decision-making.
